    <div style="background-color:white;font-size:30px"><p>We are a proud business who has served customers for decades to their utmost satisfaction.
      We have to wind back time to the late 70's, which was an entirely different world.</p>
      <p>One Muniswamy, who had just stepped into the Garden city with hopes and dreams of a new begining, from his native village unbeknowsnt to him about the legacy he is going to leave behind. He started from humble beginings with a tiny sweet and savoury shop named "Muniswamy Sweets".</p>
      <p>With his hard efforts and the using the underrated virtue of attrition, had made a name for itself all around the surrounding areas,the taste and quality of his products was unnegotiable and he passed on this trait to his son, Govindaraj, the current proprietor of
      Yumms Sweets formerly known as Muniswamy Sweets or M.S Sweets.</p></div>
